# Flight-delay-prediction
Flights Delay Prediction is a data-driven project focused on predicting the likelihood of flight delays. The goal is to create a predictive model that can estimate the probability of a flight being delayed based on various factors such as historical data, weather conditions, airline performance, and other relevant parameters.
